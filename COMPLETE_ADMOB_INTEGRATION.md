# Complete AdMob Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ What's Already Done

I've completed these steps for you:

1. ‚úÖ Created `Podfile` with Google Mobile Ads SDK
2. ‚úÖ Updated `Info.plist` with your App ID: `ca-app-pub-9779930258622875~1132662037`
3. ‚úÖ Added user tracking permission
4. ‚úÖ Added App Transport Security settings
5. ‚úÖ Updated `MonetizationManager.swift` with real Google Ads implementation
6. ‚úÖ Added your Banner Ad Unit ID: `ca-app-pub-9779930258622875/1383943470`

## üîß Step 1: Install CocoaPods Dependencies

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/monah/projects/CrystalPopJourney
pod install
```

**If you get an error**, run:
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
cd /Users/monah/projects/CrystalPopJourney
pod install
```

After installation, you'll see a message saying to use the `.xcworkspace` file from now on.

## üì± Step 2: Create Missing Ad Units in AdMob

You need to create **Interstitial** and **Rewarded** ad units:

### Create Interstitial Ad Unit:
1. Go to [https://admob.google.com](https://admob.google.com)
2. Click on your app: **"Crystal Pop Journey"**
3. Click **"Ad Units"** tab
4. Click **"Add Ad Unit"**
5. Select **"Interstitial"**
6. Name it: **"Crystal Pop Interstitial"**
7. Click **"Create Ad Unit"**
8. **Copy the Ad Unit ID** (looks like: `ca-app-pub-9779930258622875/XXXXXXXXXX`)

### Create Rewarded Ad Unit:
1. Click **"Add Ad Unit"** again
2. Select **"Rewarded"**
3. Name it: **"Crystal Pop Rewarded"**
4. Click **"Create Ad Unit"**
5. **Copy the Ad Unit ID**

## üìù Step 3: Update Ad Unit IDs

Once you have your Interstitial and Rewarded Ad Unit IDs, update `MonetizationManager.swift`:

Find these lines (around line 20-22):
```swift
// TEST IDs - Use during development
private let interstitialAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/4411468910"  // Test Interstitial
private let rewardedAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-3940256099942544/1712485313"  // Test Rewarded
```

Replace with your real IDs:
```swift
// PRODUCTION IDs - Your actual AdMob IDs
private let interstitialAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-9779930258622875/YOUR_INTERSTITIAL_ID"
private let rewardedAdUnitID = "ca-app-pub-9779930258622875/YOUR_REWARDED_ID"
```

## üöÄ Step 4: Build and Run

1. **Close the .xcodeproj if it's open**
2. **Open**: `/Users/monah/projects/CrystalPopJourney/CrystalPopJourney.xcworkspace`
3. Select your device or simulator
4. Press ‚åòR to build and run

## üß™ Testing Your Ads

### During Development (Using Test Ads):
- Test ads will show immediately
- You can click them without worry
- No risk of policy violations

### Before Publishing (Using Real Ads):
1. Replace test IDs with real IDs
2. Test on a physical device
3. **DO NOT click your own ads** (this will get you banned!)

## üìä Where Ads Appear

Your ads are already integrated in:

1. **Banner Ads**: Can be added to any view controller
   ```swift
   let bannerView = MonetizationManager.shared.createBannerView(in: self)
   view.addSubview(bannerView)
   ```

2. **Interstitial Ads**: Shows on game over
   - File: `GameScene.swift` line 362
   - Automatically triggered when game ends

3. **Rewarded Ads**: Shows in shop for bonus coins
   - File: `MenuScene.swift` line 367
   - User watches ad to get 50 coins

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: "pod: command not found"
**Solution:**
```bash
sudo gem install cocoapods
```

### Problem: Ads not showing
**Check:**
1. Are you using test IDs during development?
2. Is your internet connection working?
3. Check Xcode console for error messages
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for first ad to load

### Problem: Build errors after pod install
**Solution:**
1. Clean build folder: ‚åò‚áßK
2. Close Xcode
3. Delete `DerivedData`:
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData
   ```
4. Reopen `.xcworkspace`
5. Build again

### Problem: "GoogleMobileAds module not found"
**Solution:**
- Make sure you're opening `.xcworkspace` NOT `.xcodeproj`
- Run `pod install` again
- Clean and rebuild
