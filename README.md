## ❤️ About Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy

**Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)** is a genetic disorder that causes progressive muscle weakness. It primarily affects boys and appears in early childhood.

Children with DMD face increasing difficulty with movement, including:
- Climbing stairs
- Standing up from a seated position
- Running and playing like other children

### About Elevidys

**Elevidys** is a groundbreaking gene therapy treatment that can help slow DMD progression, offering real hope for affected children and their families.

## 💝 Why This App Matters

This game was created by a parent whose son was born in 2017 with an exon 71 mutation. He currently faces challenges like climbing stairs and uses both hands and legs to stand up. He's in grade 1 special education, and every day is a battle against this progressive disease.

**Every donation brings us closer to accessing Elevidys gene therapy treatment**, which could change his life and give him a better future.
