## 💰 Want to Add Ads Later?

Once you've tested the game and it works perfectly, you can add ads by following:

**See: `MANUAL_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`**

This will:
1. Install CocoaPods
2. Add Google Mobile Ads SDK
3. Create the `.xcworkspace` file
4. Enable ads in your app

## 🔧 Why Two Different Files?

### `.xcodeproj` (BLUE icon):
- ✅ Works immediately
- ✅ No setup needed
- ❌ Can't use external libraries (no ads)
- **Use this to test your game now!**

### `.xcworkspace` (WHITE icon):
- ✅ Includes external libraries (ads)
- ❌ Requires CocoaPods setup
- **Use this after you run `pod install`**

---

## 📋 Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Open project (no ads)
open CrystalPopJourney.xcodeproj

# OR open project (with ads, after pod install)
open CrystalPopJourney.xcworkspace
```

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The hardest part is done! Your game is **production-ready** except for ads.

### Next Steps:
1. ✅ **Test the game** (use .xcodeproj)
2. ✅ **Take screenshots** for App Store
3. ✅ **Create app icons** (`python3 create_icons.py`)
4. ⏳ **Add ads later** (follow `MANUAL_SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
5. ⏳ **Publish to App Store** (see `COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)

## 💡 Pro Tip

It's actually **BETTER** to test without ads first! This way you can:
